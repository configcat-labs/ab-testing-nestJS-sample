This repo contains the source code for the Student Management System website for the article:  A/B Testing in Nest.js with [ConfigCat](https://configcat.com) and Amplitude. The website was built with Nest.js in the backend, and React.js in the frontend.
The A/B test compares two variations of a newsletter on the homepage of the website.

## Build & Run
Instructions for building:

To run the backend
